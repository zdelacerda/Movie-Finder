# Movie-Finder
## About
A box-office movie recommendation service. 

This is a program that notifies you -by text or email- about potentially interesting movies playing at your favorite/local cinema. The concept of an 'interesting movie' is derived by either using machine learning (requires enough data from IMDB account or other source) or a handcrafted algorithm to identify which current box-office movies the user would be most interested in. For example, if you have a long history of watching and enjoying a certain genre, certain actor, or movies directed by a particular director, when a similar movie is released in the box-office you will receive a notification referring you to the movie.
